## Closest Pair Project CSC 2400
> As part of a project for our CSC 2400, this project is meant to reinforce
> our understanding of emperical analysis and application on real world algorithms.
> 
> Using KD Trees and Divide-and-Conquer methods, this project aims to empirically analyze both methods
> to compare which sovles the closest pair problem more efficiently.
> Jupyter Notebook was used to visualize analysis of both methods.
